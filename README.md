## Problem Statement
The bike sales company faces challenges in understanding the factors influencing customer purchasing behaviour. Key variables such as age, income, commute distance, and geographic region are not fully analyzed, limiting the ability to target specific customer segments effectively.

Without a clear understanding of how these variables impact bike sales, the company struggles to:

- Identify the most profitable customer segments.
- Tailor marketing strategies to different demographic and regional preferences.
- Optimize product offerings based on commute and income patterns.

This project aims to use Excel to analyze the relationship between these variables and bike sales performance. By uncovering trends and insights, the analysis will support data-driven decisions to improve marketing strategies, enhance customer targeting, and boost overall sales.
